# RecommendSomething 🔮

This project is should a fun and small personal project for recommendations. I got the inspiration from the staff picked portfolio projects on Codecademy🏫.

My vision is a web hosted page via Django on a ☁cloud☁ (probably AWS or Telekom Cloud).

The Page RecommendSomething should be a community driven share page for every kind of interest.

Imagine binging through 📼movies/series/anime,🎮games,📚books,🏁sports or anything else, but you somehow got tired of it (or maybe finished it) and need a type of recommendation for something else that is interesting or fun.
Of course you could just google the answer or lurk on reddit for recommendations🧠. But you kind of search for something you already have in mind.

With RecommendSomething you can give an honest recommendation for something you liked and tag it with some keywords.

Here are some ideas that could fit the project:

- [ ] backlog for you to track recommendations, that you bookmarked
- [ ] a progress and statbar
- [ ] random recommendation -> a button to show just something anybody liked
- [ ] private and public lists



👩‍💻 Of course the major priority of this project is to learn and hone my skills in Python, CI/CD, Frontend, SQL and every other involved tool.
